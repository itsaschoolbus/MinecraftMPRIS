## NOTE
This mod currently does not work on Windows (due to the dependency on MPRIS), but Windows support is planned!

# MinecraftMPRIS

A Minecraft mod that allows you to display media (as an overlay) and control it in-game!

## Features

- Shows all the metadata you want
- Customizable (thanks to [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)!)
- Lightweight

## Requirements

- Linux
- playerctl
- A MPRIS-compatible player (Spotify, mpv,...)

## Compatibility with web browsers
- Please consider installing [Plasma Browser Integration](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Browser_Integration) if you plan on playing media in web browsers, as it will provide better metadata
